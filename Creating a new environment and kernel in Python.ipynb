    "### Creating a Virtual Environment \n",
    "\n",
    "This will walk students through how they can build a new virtual environment within anaconda for Python, and then also generate a new kernel for use in Jupyter notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why Do This? \n",
    "\n",
    "For weeks 7 & 8 we will be using Tensorflow & Keras, which both can be tough to install at times. So I would encourage students to build a new virtual environment following this documentation and then install tensorflow, keras and any other relevant packages there. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Resources:\n",
    "\n",
    "The following links are helpful and were referenced in putting this document together: \n",
    "\n",

    "#### 1) Open Up Terminal & Navigate to Directory you will use \n",
    "\n",
    "- Mac users can just use terminal\n",
    "- Windows users should be using the anaconda terminal"

    "#### 2) Verify Conda has been updated:\n",
    "\n",
    "- This will update any packages you have, helpful first step \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "conda update conda \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3) Create a Virtual Environment:\n",
    "\n",
    "This will allow you to create an environment that is independent of your other environments. For example, we may want to create a virtual environment that has Python 2.7 and one that has Python 3.6.\n",
    "\n",
    "Code below is going to build out a new environment. Note the following parameters: \n",
    "\n",
    "- `yourenvname`: This is what you want to call your environment \n",
    "\n",
    "- `x.x`: This is the Python version you will use \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "conda create -n yourenvname python=x.x anaconda\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of building a new environment for python 3.6 called `ml_py36`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since I dropped the `anaconda` at the end of the command, I will not be installing all libraries that usually come with an install. This means I won't get pandas, sklearn, etc. unless I decide to install those. If you have the time, go ahead and install with anaconda. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python \n",
    "conda create -n ml_py36 python=3.6 \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4) Activate Your New Virtual Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "I have found two commands for this, and it might depend on your specific setup as to which works. \n",
    "\n",
    "Documentation says to use the following, where `yourenvname` is the name of the new environment you created. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python \n",
    "source activate yourenvname\n",
    "```\n",
    "Alternatively, the following command is what I run on my Windows machine: \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "activate ml_py36\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: You can verify that you are in the correct environment by looking at the parentheses to the left of your command prompt. Below we see that I am working in the `ml_py36` environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "![ve](image/virtual_env.JPG)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5) Start Installing Packages: \n",
    "\n",
    "Once you are inside your new virtual environment, you can start installing specific packages of interest. Please note that you can specify versions if desired. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can check with packages are installed in your virtual environment by running the following command: \n",
    "\n",
    "```python \n",
    "conda list\n",
    "```\n",
    "Example: \n",
    "![conda_list](image/conda_list.JPG)\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, use the following command to install new packages into this new kernel (note we must specify the environment):\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "conda install -n ml_py36 keras\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6) Set-up Kernel for Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you have built a new environment you will want to use it in Jupyter Notebook sessions. Make sure that you are still working within your new virtual environment. \n",
    "\n",
    "The following is very helpful documentation for this: https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install/kernel_install.html#kernels-for-different-environments\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensure that pip is installed. Update to newest version if needed: \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "conda install pip\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we will install `ipykernel` which allows for multiple IPython kernels (i.e. Ability to switch between virtual environments). A kernel is just a way for our jupyter notebook to utilize the virtual environment. \n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "conda install ipykernel\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, former students have found this last part to be helpful. It allows you to specify the environment to create a kernel for as well as a name to display.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "python -m ipykernel install --user --name myenv --display-name \"Python (myenv)\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: I will create a kernel for \"ml_py36\" and under display name I will call is \"ml_py36\"\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "python -m ipykernel install --user --name ml_py36 --display-name \"ml_py36\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 7) Launch Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "Within the command line you can launch a new jupyter notebook session. Example below: \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "jupyter notebook\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Once fully connected, a new browser should open with your session. The browser will open based on the current directory your command line is in, so navigate to wherever your files are prior to running the above command. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note: If a new browser does not open, you should see information around the localhost. You can copy the info up to the token. \n",
    "\n",
    "From the example below, I would just put the following in the browser of choice: http://localhost:8889/\n",
    "\n",
    "Then I would just add the token (covered by red below!)\n",
    "\n",
    "![local_host](image/jp_local.JPG)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 8) Select Kernel Within Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "If all has worked, you should see an option to work from the environment created. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note: I failed to add the `--display-name` before making this tutorial so my kernel is a bit messy. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "![nb_kern](image/notebook_kernel.JPG)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
